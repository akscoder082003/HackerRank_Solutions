-- Generate the following two result sets:

-- Query an alphabetically ordered list of all names in OCCUPATIONS, immediately followed by the first letter of each profession as a parenthetical (i.e.: enclosed in parentheses). For example: AnActorName(A), ADoctorName(D), AProfessorName(P), and ASingerName(S).
-- Query the number of ocurrences of each occupation in OCCUPATIONS. Sort the occurrences in ascending order, and output them in the following format:

-- There are a total of [occupation_count] [occupation]s.
-- where [occupation_count] is the number of occurrences of an occupation in OCCUPATIONS and [occupation] is the lowercase occupation name. If more than one Occupation has the same [occupation_count], they should be ordered alphabetically.

select concat(Name, '(',left(occupation, 1),')')
from occupations order by Name;

select concat('There are a total of ', count(occupation), 
' ', lower(occupation),'s.')
from occupations
group by occupation 
order by count(occupation) asc, occupation asc;
